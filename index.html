                I'm a bartender at the the Stinking Rose and while something stinking doesnt sound appetizing, this position has offered a lot of opportunity for fun and great connections since it's located in the crazy, bustling city of Beverly Hills. I'm a man who likes to talk to individuals, work hard, and most of all learn about new experiences that are exciting and different. I always like to say "I don't know what I don't know, but I'll find out". Leading a lifestyle based on this motto has allowed me to continue being a life long learner and let me tell you... being from Seattle is great, but in LA â€“ there's something for everyone.

                From visiting masked Mexican luchador fights to visiting the first speakesie in Los Angeles where the beef dip sandwich was invented, I have been able to appreciate my surroundings and share my exeriences with others. I love to have fun, but ultimtely family comes first. They are my life line, my upbringing, and my future.
